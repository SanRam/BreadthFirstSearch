BreadthFirstSearch
==================

Breadth First Search in C++

1. Perform a breadth-Ô¨Årst search of the graph and output a label for each node. Your program should ask
for the starting node. The output labels for nodes that are not reachable from the starting node should
be INFINITY.
2. Print all the tree edges.
3. Attempt to classify the remaining edges.
